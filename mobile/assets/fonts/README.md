# Font Files Needed

The app requires JetBrains Mono font files. Please download them from:
https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/

Required files:
- JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf
- JetBrainsMono-Bold.ttf

Place these files in the `assets/fonts/` directory.

Alternatively, you can use system fonts by modifying `app/_layout.tsx` to remove the font loading code.
